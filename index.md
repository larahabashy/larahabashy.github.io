## Hi, I’m Lara!

I am a math enthuasiant with a Bachelor's degree in Statistics from Carleton University, and a Masters degree in Data Science from the University of British Columbia. I developed a passion for data science and machine learning during my time as a third year Actuarial Sciences student. Since then, I have completed a minor in Computer Science and participated in many data science hackathons and projects. 
My most recent work has been the development of a machine learning solution for diagnosing Lipohypertrophy masses in diabetic patients’ ultrasound images. Since seeing the potential of innovating health using machine learning, I am dedicated to actively working on cutting-edge novel solutions to combat threats and challenges to public health. Although I lack a health sciences background, I am quite confident that my eagerness and willingness to learn will push me to thrive in that area! I am committed to bridging the gap between data and solutions, especially in the healthcare domain where patients' health could be improved.  

Besides professional interests, I enjoy playing badminton, hiking, and keeping up with motorsport. I’m a huge formula 1 fan and I’m constantly looking at ways to apply data science solutions to motorsport. If you have any ideas, shoot me an email!
